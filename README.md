# bermudaairlines
This website was created as a final project for a databases class. It mimics a database an airline would you. It allows entering of airports, planes, staff and their sallary, customers, flights, and allows you to search for customers and book, then later check in a ticket, where you can enter luggage info. It was hand coded in php and JavaScript with bootstrap to clean up the front end.
